= Building AXCIOMA or TAOX11

This is a fork of https://github.com/RemedyIT/axcioma[the main repository] for https://www.axcioma.org[AXCIOMA] and https://www.taox11.org[TAOX11].
AXCIOMA and TAOX11 are created and maintained by https://www.remedy.nl[Remedy IT].
This repository contains the bootstrap tooling to obtain AXCIOMA or TAOX11 and to generate the necessary
configuration using link:brix11/docs/src/brix11.adoc[BRIX11].

In this fork, the bootstrap command has an additional option to make shallow clones of repositories, to speed up bootstrapping.

== Prerequisites

Before bootstrapping AXCIOMA make sure you have installed the following prerequisites

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=========================================
|Prerequisite |Package name
|ruby 2.0 or newer|ruby
|perl version 5.10 or newer |perl
|git |git
|gcc version 4.7 or newer |gcc
|g++ version 4.7 or newer |gcc-c++
|xerces-c++ version 3.0 or newer |xerces-c
|GNU make version 3.81 or newer |make
|GNU Bash|bash
|=========================================

== Build steps

After cloning this repository to your local system you need to

. Bootstrap
. Configure
. Generate
. Compile

This can be done all together by executing the following commands

 bin/brix11 bootstrap -s
 bin/brix11 configure
 bin/brix11 gen build workspace.mwc
 bin/brix11 make

For all commands additional help is available by executing `bin/brix11 help _command_`.

== Bootstrap

AXCIOMA is the default target for bootstrapping. The bootstrap command will clone all dependent git repositories to their expected location. This can be done by executing

 bin/brix11 bootstrap -s

TAOX11 can be specified as optional target, which is done using

 bin/brix11 bootstrap -s taox11

== Configure

The configure step generates the necessary configuration files for the specified target (execute `bin/brix11 help configure' for more details). The configure step is performed by executing

 bin/brix11 configure

NOTE: Configure doesn't use your current environment, when you want configure to use your current environment
use `bin/brix11 -E configure`. When using the `-E` switch you have to keep in mind you will have to keep using
that switch when building project files, running make and running tests. +
As alternative you can specify configuration variables as argument to configure,
for example `-W nddshome=$HOME/NDDS/rti_connext_dds-5.2.3 -W nddsarch=x64Linux3gcc4.8.2` to specify the
RTI Connext DDS home and architecture. This will cause the settings to be stored in the BRIX11 configuration.
The `bin/brix11 env` command will show you all environment variables set up by BRIX11.

== Generate build artifacts

The generate step will generate the necessary build infrastructure using https://github.com/DOCGroup/MPC[MPC] to compile the core of the target.

 bin/brix11 gen build workspace.mwc

== Compile

The compile step will compile the core of the target with the default compiler for your platform

 bin/brix11 make

== Generate user documentation

User documentation can be generated using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] using

 bin/brix11 generate documentation

After generation the documentation can be found under `docs/html`. A good place to start reading is the `getting_started.html`
document (either under `docs/html/ciaox11` for AXCIOMA or `docs/html/taox11` for TAOX11).
